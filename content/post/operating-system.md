If there's only one course need to learn in computer science branch, I will recommend **Operating System**. 

Modern OS is getting more complex due to the development of hardware. More and more features are add to OS kernel. But the foundamental concepts are similar.

Most of OS are written by C, so in order to read OS, you need to learn [C programming language]({{< ref "/c.md" >}}) first.

Keep in mind, from a programmer's perspective, an OS is an implementation of hardwares(CPU, devices). Most of the features, such as **paging**, **user mode**, **kernel mode** etc, are provided by CPU.

To be honest, the concepts in OS are easy to forget if you didn't have a deep understand of it. In order to learn OS well, you need to combine practice with theory. Like for a instance, it's better for you to write a couple of codes to build a small application than just reading a book.

The goals in a multiple uer, time-share OS are multiplexing, isolation and interaction.

Overall, the basic and the most important part in a OS are:
- [**Process**]({{< ref "/process-implementation.md" >}})
- [**Memory**]({{< ref "/memory-implementation.md" >}})
- **File System**
- **Input and Output**

In this article, we just focus on *what*, you can check out *how* is each detail implementated on each section.
## Process
We all know that programs written by a user or programmer using high-level programming language, such as C, Java, Js etc, run on CPU(Central Process Unit). 

On one hand, a process is an instance of a program running on a machine, on the other hand, process is an abstraction of CPU.

A binary code of a program (generated by compiler) loaded to memory and CPU execute every instructions. It exited after execution. A process maybe suspended by the OS(schedualer) to run another process. We can see that a process has a state and a life-cycle. 

## Memory
Every process has its owen private address space. Do you know why? Due to isolation! Because an OS should make sure process A shouldn't interrupt process B.

Virtual memory is provided by the hardware, MMU(Memory Management Unit), a unit of CPU. We can say design a OS is just hardware-oriented programming, in other words, build a OS is implementting the interface provied by the hardware, usually the CPU.

We should know how does VM(Virtual Memory) work and how does it implemented.

A byte is too small to load and write between CPU and Memory. So computer scientists 

MMU translate VM to PM(Physical Memory).

Every process has a page table.

Page talbe(stored in pysical memory) is logically an array of page table entries.
So what is a page table entry?
Page table entry is a fixed lengh bits = PPN(Physical Page Number) + flags

page table = page table entries[]
